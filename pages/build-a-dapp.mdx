# DOCUMENTATION WILL BE ADDED

The Nextra framework with which this website was built takes in .mdx documentation files.

The .mdx file extension typically refers to files in the MDX (Markdown with JSX) format. MDX is a file format that combines Markdown, a lightweight markup language, with JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for embedding JavaScript code within HTML-like tags.

MDX files are commonly used in web development for creating dynamic and interactive content. They allow you to write richly formatted text using Markdown syntax and embed React components or JavaScript code directly within the document. This combination of Markdown and JSX makes MDX files powerful for creating documentation, blog posts, and other content that can include both static and interactive elements.

MDX files can be processed by specific tools or frameworks, such as Gatsby or Next.js, which can render the MDX content into HTML for web display. These tools enable the execution of the embedded JavaScript code and provide a seamless integration of Markdown and React components.

In summary, the .mdx file extension represents files in the MDX format, which combines Markdown and JSX to create dynamic and interactive content, commonly used in web development.
