# xCall dapps on EVM chains

Interacting with dApps connected with xcall requires you to be able to do the following tasks:
* Call readonly methods on the specific chain.
* Sign transactions invoking methods on smart contracts on the specific chain.
* Fetch or listening to events being raised on smart contracts on the specific chain.

On this tutorial we are going to showcase examples on doing all of this tasks for EVM chains using Javascript more specifically the [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) and/or [web3js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) sdk's which are the most common libraries used for interacting with EVM chains.

For more in-depth details on the code and live testing this scenario you can clone our [xcall-scaffolding](https://github.com/icon-project/xcall-scaffolding) repo, in there you can find an specific demo that execute all the steps for a cross-chain transaction on a [JVM-EVM scenario](https://github.com/icon-project/xcall-scaffolding/blob/main/demo/demos/jvm-evm-helloWorld.mjs).

## Call readonly methods on EVM chains.
## Sign transactions on EVM chains.
## Fetch and/or listening for events on smart contracts on EVM chains.
