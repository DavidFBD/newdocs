# xCall dapps on COSMWASM chains

Interacting with dApps connected with xcall requires you to be able to do the following tasks:
* Call readonly methods on the specific chain.
* Sign transactions invoking methods on smart contracts on the specific chain.
* Fetch or listening to events being raised on smart contracts on the specific chain.

On this tutorial we are going to showcase examples on doing all of this tasks for COSMWASM chains using Javascript more specifically the [cosmjs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs).

For more in-depth details on the code and live testing this scenario you can clone our [xcall-scaffolding](https://github.com/icon-project/xcall-scaffolding) repo, in there you can find an specific demo that execute all the steps for a cross-chain transaction on a [JVM-COSMWASM scenario](https://github.com/icon-project/xcall-scaffolding/blob/main/demo/demos/jvm-cosmwasm-helloWorld.mjs).

## Call readonly methods on COSMWASM chains.
## Sign transactions on COSMWASM chains.
## Fetch and/or listening for events on smart contracts on COSMWASM chains.
