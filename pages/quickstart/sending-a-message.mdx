In the following document we are going to go in detail about the process of sending a cross chain encoded message using xCall.

The following example uses a program written in JavaScript (nodejs) and the repository for it can be found in the following link:

* https://github.com/icon-community/xcall-sample-dapp

We are going to interact with 2 local blockchains, one representing the ICON Network and the other representing any EVM blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, etc) and send a hex encoded string as a message from the ICON chain to the EVM chain.

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite to follow this tutorial first you have to setup the local environment, which can be done following the steps detailed in this tutorial:

* [BTP Tutorial: Setting up BTP Locally for Testing.](https://icon.community/tutorials/btp-tutorial-setting-up-btp-locally-for-testing/)

In order to run the example being shown in here it is necessary that both local networks from the BTP tutorial are up and running and you also need to have the relayer running (the steps for doing this are detailed in the tutorial).
Once your local BTP environment is running a file named deployments.json will be generated at the root folder of the e2edemo dapp of the btp2 repository, this file contains the information of all the smart contracts deployed on both networks and other BTP related information, the file will look like this:

```filename="" copy
insert code here
```
